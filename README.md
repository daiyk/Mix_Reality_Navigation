# Mixed Reality Navigation 

## Project Description
This project is an android-based Mixed-Reality application that build graph-based map by dropping spatial anchors, and navigates user to and from any two chosen anchors. Our application fully relies on the image recognition (SLAM) for anchor detection, where the anchor-related images are stored in the Azure cloud application - Azure Spatial Anchors. Our demo shows that the application can store the visual  environment information and build them into map, and the map can be efficiently utilized to do navigation for any chosen destination.
